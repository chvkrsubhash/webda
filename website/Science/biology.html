        <p>Biology is the scientific study of life. It is a natural science with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single,
             coherent field. For instance, all organisms are made up of cells that process hereditary information encoded in genes, 
             which can be transmitted to future generations.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts in Biology</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Life: Life is a complex and dynamic process that is characterized by several key features, including the ability to reproduce, grow, and adapt to the environment.</li>
            <li>Cells: Cells are the basic units of life. All organisms are made up of cells, and cells are the smallest units that can carry out the functions of life.</li>
            <li>Genes: Genes are the units of heredity. They are passed from parents to offspring and contain the instructions for building and maintaining an organism.</li>
            <li>Evolution: Evolution is the process of change over time. It is the driving force behind the diversity of life on Earth.</li>
            <li>Energy: Energy is essential for life. Organisms must obtain energy from their environment in order to survive and reproduce.</li>
            <li>Homeostasis: Homeostasis is the ability of an organism to maintain a stable internal environment. This is necessary for the organism to function properly.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Biology is a fascinating and important field of science. It is used to understand the world around us and to develop new technologies.</p>
