        <p>Chemistry is the scientific study of matter, its properties, and how it changes. It is the study of the composition, structure, and properties of matter, as well as the changes that matter undergoes during chemical reactions. Chemistry is a broad and diverse field, and it is used in many different fields, such as medicine, engineering, and environmental science.</p>

        <h2>Key Concepts in Chemistry</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Elements: Elements are the basic building blocks of matter. There are 118 elements, each with its own unique set of properties.</li>
            <li>Compounds: Compounds are substances that are made up of two or more elements. They are formed when atoms of different elements combine.</li>
            <li>Molecules: Molecules are the smallest units of a compound that can exist independently. They are made up of atoms that are bonded together.</li>
            <li>Chemical reactions: Chemical reactions are processes that involve the rearrangement of atoms. They can be used to create new substances or to break down existing substances.</li>
            <li>Energy: Energy is involved in all chemical reactions. It can be released or absorbed during a reaction.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Chemistry is a fascinating and important field of science. It is used to understand the world around us and to develop new technologies.</p>
