    <div class="dpt">
        <p>Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, with its main goal being to understand how the universe behaves. A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist.</p>

        <p>Physics covers a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particles (such as quarks, neutrinos, and electrons) to the largest superclusters of galaxies. Included in these phenomena are the most basic objects composing all other things. Therefore, physics is sometimes called the "fundamental science". Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in terms of simpler phenomena. Thus, physics aims to both connect the things observable to humans to root causes, and then connect these causes together.</p>
    
        <h2>Major Branches of Physics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Classical mechanics: This branch of physics deals with the motion of objects under the influence of forces. It is the foundation of many other branches of physics, such as thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics.</li>
            <li>Thermodynamics: This branch of physics deals with the relationships between heat, work, and energy. It is important in understanding the behavior of matter and energy at the macroscopic level.</li>
            <li>Electromagnetism: This branch of physics deals with the interactions between electric and magnetic fields. It is important in understanding the behavior of light, electricity, and magnetism.</li>
            <li>Quantum mechanics: This branch of physics deals with the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic level. It is important in understanding the behavior of atoms, molecules, and other fundamental particles.</li>
            <li>Relativity: This branch of physics deals with the relationship between space and time. It is important in understanding the behavior of objects at very high speeds or in very strong gravitational fields.</li>
